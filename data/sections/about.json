    "text": "I'm a product designer in San Francisco, passionate about process, design systems, teams, collaboration, and developing culture. I dove headfirst into graphic design and illustration early on in my career, but quickly realized I was driven to design meaningful experiences for people and products rather than focusing only on visual craft. I now emphasize a balance between both and champion a human-centric approach to my process. During my focus on agency work, I was privileged to work on great projects with Mossio, Knife & Fox and most recently Ueno. I’m now pursuing opportunities to contribute value from early UX to final pixels, prioritizing people at the heart of what I do."
