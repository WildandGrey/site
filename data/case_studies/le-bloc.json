      "Already posessing a brand identity and an elemental e-commerce website, they needed someone to focus on designing the user experience flow for the customization process on their product details pages. I worked with them to develop this process and add a level of visual finesse and simplicity that would uplift their site. Meant to be responsive, I also designed the mobile version of the Le Bloc product detail pages."
