      "The Pilot app is a translation application that corresponds with its smart wearables counterpart developed by Waverly Labs, a consumer electronics company. They use the latest technologies in machine translation and speech recognition for their flagship product to allow wearers to speak different languages while clearly understanding each other.",
      "After the viral success of their <a data-interaction=\"link\" class=\"fw-bold c-coal td-none ttf-ease_in_out td-0_15s tp-color\" href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meet-the-pilot-smart-earpiece-language-translator-headphones-travel#/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo</a> video, I was brought in to concept and design the first MVP. The first version would be a simple stand-alone app. Its scope was intentionally kept to a minimum, offering speech translation in only 5 languages. Quality of experience and relevance to the target demographic were top priorities, as was developing an intuitive way for users to submit feedback during beta."

Learning which languages they prioritized for both leisure and business purposes helped inform which five language offerings would be available in beta and which language would be the app default."
