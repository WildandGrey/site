      "Whether as an exercise in creativity or a test to solve for real-life, I love to push boundaries and explore. I frequently create specific challenges for myself. Some of my constraints might include a time limit, which pushes me to work efficiently under pressure, ideate and iterate faster, and design for the sake of an inhibited creative process. On other occasions I focus less on visual output and refinement and more on research, idea generation, and complex problem-solving."
